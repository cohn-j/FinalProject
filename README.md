# FinalProject
2020 Data Visualization Final Project Repo
The new generation of kids will never know the original 150 Pokémon. Our team decided to build a Pokédex for them to identify silhouettes - like the television show would do before going to commercial break - using a machine learning algorithm to predict the correct name of each Pokémon.

Steps involved:

	1. We will get images of the Pokémon using a web scrapper to get in bulk
	2. Take the names of each Pokémon and load them to their designated folder using Pandas
	3. AWS to host the images 
	4. Add classifications 
	5. Feed it into the training model
	6. Use the model to predict
	7. Create user web application to match the Machine Learning results vs User input and score the comparison.
